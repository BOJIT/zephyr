	  RX thread stack size

	int "WCH Ethernet RX Thread Priority"
	default 2
	help
	  This option allows to configure the priority of the RX thread that
	  handles incoming Ethernet packets.
	  Switching between preemptive and cooperative scheduling can be done by
	  NET_TC_THREAD_PREEMPTIVE.
	  Preemptive scheduling can lead to more responsive handling of network traffic,
	  especially under high load.

config ETH_WCH_HW_CHECKSUM
	bool "Use TX and RX hardware checksum"
	default n
	help
	  Enable receive and transmit checksum offload to enhance throughput
	  performances.

config ETH_WCH_MULTICAST_FILTER
	bool "Multicast hash filter support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for multicast hash filtering in the MAC.
	  Once enabled the ethernet MAC performs imperfect filtering
	  based on a computed hash of the destination MAC address of
	  the multicast address. Only multicast with the computed
	  hash set in the multicast table will be received and all
	  other multicast is dropped by the MAC. If disabled then all
	  multicast is received by the MAC.
